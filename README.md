# FLARES III: The properties of massive dusty galaxies at cosmic dawn

This repo contains code to recreate the plots in [Vijayan et al. (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.tmp..355V/abstract).

The data required to make the plots are in the folder ```data``` as ```flares_skirt_outputs.hdf5```. The description of the datasets can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YCIwxBv2NlgQq5aS0F_3VTJKeaDUUurfH0wTF71TaeE/edit?usp=sharing). The SEDs of the galaxies are not included. Please do get in touch if additional data is required.
